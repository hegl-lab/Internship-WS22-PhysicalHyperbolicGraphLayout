Hyperbolic Graph Layout
- Graph Input
- Physics Simulation
- Hyperbolic Space
- Pictoral Output


run.py: Use hardcoded filename and run basic layout pipeline

Basic Layout Pipelline

1. graphinput.py: Read edgelist from file and convert to python graph representatation (https://graph-tool.skewed.de)
2. graphlayout.py: From graph represenation produce a layout


ex.
edglist.txt = "1,2\n 2,3"
layout.txt = "1 x1 y1\n 2 x2 y2\n 3 x3 y3"
